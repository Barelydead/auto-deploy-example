                        <p>Most water barrier products do not breathe, trapping moisture within the
                        substrate, causing delamination and degradation to the substrate and
                        promotes the growth of mold and mildew. RDC does not allow water to
                        Penetrate the coating and subsequent substrate, yet it allows any
                        moisture vapor within the substrate to escape and evaporate. RDC was
                        specifically engineered and formulated to achieve a perm rating of 12.
                        This is because a 12-perm rating is precisely what makes RDC a
                        perfectly balanced/formulated (breathable) water barrier coating.</p>
