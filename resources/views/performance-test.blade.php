Primers were NEVER applied on any item tested. In most cases, two coats of RDC product were applied to achieve RDC’s optimum cured thickness of 10-12 dry mils. All dry weather test samples were gently cleaned with dish soap and warm water prior to being photographed.</p>

This product was originally manufactured and canned in August 2005—12 years prior. These containers had been opened several times over time and were stored indoors under extreme hot and cold environments, with ambient room temperatures ranging from 18°f-160°f for all of the 12 years. </p>

                    <p>The two images (LEFT) depict (above shown) 12 year old RDC Formula A2 after the product was transferred to a new 1-quart paint can, then a small amount of tap water was added and the can was shaken at a local paint outlet. Amazingly all product remained fully usable after 12 years of storage, all of which was actually used in 2017 to create additional test samples now in progress and shown in this presentation. This is unarguably an AMAZING, unmatched discovery. RDC is not aware of any paint or coating company on this planet that can claim (and prove) a 12+ year shelf-life. </p>

The lid was lightly rinsed off with tap water only, allowed to dry, and then the underside was coated directly over the shown corrosion and rust with RDC’s 12-year-old (revived) A2 Coating.  The lid was then placed in an outdoor weather testing bin mentioned in the previous slide in Aug 2017 (Image 2).  No primers, including rust inhibiting primers were used; only RDC A2 Coating was used for this (and all) tests.  </p>

                        <p>The lid was removed from the bin, was gently cleaned off with soap and water and inspected on Jan 24, 2018.  To date,  there were no signs of any corrosion bleed through, no new corrosion, no delamination, nor any evidence of any coating failure whatsoever, again using 12-year-old RDC A2 Coating.  In fact, the lid looked as good as it did the day it was coated as the images clearly show.  The lid was returned to the bin for continued weather/anti-corrosion testing.</p>
