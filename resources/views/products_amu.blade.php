                            RDC passed this test

                            impact at 160 + in.lbs.

                            RDC is an A-1 Rated Fire
                            Retardant product. As
                            such, in the event of a
                            fire, there is more time
                            to escape without deadly
                            smoke and limited flame
                            spread, resulting in
                            reduced risk of loss of
                            life and property.

                            had a flame spread of
                            only 3.9’ with ZERO
                            SMOKE. Also, there
