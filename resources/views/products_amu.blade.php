            <p>
                RDC will withstand normal building expansion and contraction by stretching and recovering (like a rubber band) and will span most cracks under 1/8 th of an inch in width.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, RDC has great flexibility without cracking. Lack of sufficient elongation or flexibility will most assuredly lead to early chipping, cracking, and flaking.

            <h4 class="rdcorange-text">MOISTURE MANAGEMENT</h4>
            <p>
                RDC was formulated with a precise perm rating of 12 which provides a water-proof quality, but also offers the perfect high breathability rating, which allows water vapor to escape, helping in the prevention of unhealthful mold and mildew inside wall structures, etc. This also greatly extends the life of both the coating and the substrate.

            <p>
                RDC has a significantly higher spread rate, a substantially longer life with fewer repaints and will drastically reduce labor and energy costs. RDC will endure without failure for decades, providing consumers a Lifetime Warranty. This superior two-coat system offers a high degree of protection, resulting in a much lower life cycle cost, providing considerable savings to consumers.

            <p>
                Due to RDC’s NASA grade ceramic and reflective technology, RDC augments existing insulation systems to significantly reduce energy costs, which tested at up to 52% savings in energy costs during summer months.
            </p>
            <p>
                RDC reflects back heat and slows heat conductivity to keep structures cooler in summer months.
