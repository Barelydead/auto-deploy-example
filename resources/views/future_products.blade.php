            <h2>WeatherSEAL&#8482; UnderCoat</h2>
            RDC is very confident we can replace most,
            if not all existing applications/installations of
            today’s required construction tar-paper,
            which is used primarily as a water barrier
            during the construction of just about all
            roofs and most exterior wall systems.
            Today’s construction tar-paper is harmful to
            the environment, rips and tears during
            installation, is compromised when nailed
            through, is much more labor intensive to
            apply and most of all—it is highly
            flammable.
            On the other hand, RDC’s future
            WeatherSEAL&#8482; UnderCoat:
            <ul>
                <li>carries an A1 Fire Retardant Rating</li>
                <li>is water-based/Green & protects the environment</li>
                <li>is waterproof, yet breathable</li>
                <li>has a zero percent chance of water
                intrusion through the coating for the life
                of the roof/structure</li>
                <li>holds thermal properties that save
                energy</li>
                <li>can be quickly applied by standard paint
                sprayer, roller or brush</li>
                <li>self-seals around nails/punctures</li>
                <li>will bridge over spaces up to 1/8” wide
                between plywood boards</li>
                <li>will not crack, blister or delaminate and
                will last and protect for the life of the
                roof/structure</li>
            </ul>

                RDC is confident we can replace many existing harsh,
                highly flammable epoxy applications with our up and
                coming Green/water-based PoxyGREEN&#8482; Coating,
                which our testing shows is actually stronger than most
                epoxies, will carry an A1 Fire Retardant Rating and will
                outlast and outperform most epoxies by many years.

                    <li>will hold thermal properties that save energy</li>
                    <li>can be quickly applied by standard paint
                    sprayer, roller or brush as simple 1-part system
                    <li>will bridge over spaces up to 1/8” wide</li>
                    <li>will not crack, blister or delaminate and will last
                    and protect for the life of the substrate</li>
                    <li>will cost much less than most epoxies</li>

                With some modifications to our AMU Coating,
                RDC plans to introduce a very durable/long
                lasting, protective clear-coat product,
                ClearSEAL&#8482; Coating, to compete against the
                likes of Thompson’s Water-Seal. ClearSEAL&#8482;
                Coating will be formulated to used on most
                substrates, including, wood, metal, concrete,
                tiles and more.
