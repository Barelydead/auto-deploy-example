                    The centuries old paint industry has been asleep for decades and remains so today.  No other paint/coatings company on this planet delivers quality, lasting, innovative exterior paint/coatings products.  Premature exterior paint failure remains at epidemic proportions worldwide, leaving consumers highly frustrated and on the hunt for real and lasting solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Addressing this global demand, RDC has created a groundbreaking, advanced suite of “super” paints/coatings and building repair products.  We are proudly and boldly leading the charge in transforming the paint and coatings industry by, quite frankly, reinventing paint.
                </p>
                <p>
                    RDC has, to date, compiled over 12 years (and counting) of live product testing, exposing our products 24/7 against the most severe outdoor weather conditions known to man.  Additionally, to date, RDC has conducted an exhaustive list of 44 ASTM International tests of its products (and counting), including powerful ASTM testing for fire protection, waterproofing, anti-corrosion, thermal barrier protection, super strong adhesion and abrasion resistance performance, mold abatement, long product life, color retention, accelerated weather testing, and on and on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are very confident there are no other paint or coating products on the world market today that can confidently make such remarkable product performance claims, all of which are scientifically proven/supported by both extensive live (ongoing) internal and outside independent testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Highlighting just a few of our bold product performance claims, RDC will adhere (like Super-Glue) to just about any surface for a lifetime—above or below fresh/salt water or even in battery acid, it’s Green/water-based, fireproof, waterproof yet breathable (which abates household mold), saves energy, covers over/resists corrosion, is stronger than epoxy, delivers fast dry times, offers fast/easy soap and water clean-up, includes a Lifetime Warranty, and on and on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    RDC products make up an only-in-class suite of “super-paints and coatings”.  Our highly guarded, proprietary (mysterious) blend of the most advanced, highest quality ingredients, including nanotechnology and other late breaking, cutting-edge raw materials, is how we are able to provide consumers the only groundbreaking, reinvented paint/coating products available globally—all supported by unmatched testing in the industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our suite of amazing products can be applied onto seemingly endless applications as our exciting Home page slideshow depicts, which are various examples of some of our product application types.  RDC products will adhere incredibly and for a lifetime to just about any substrate, usually without any primers.  The following is an example of some of our direct applications: all wood, concrete, asphalt, brick/masonry, stucco, roof coatings/tiles, glass, vinyl, fiberglass, PVC/plastic, Styrofoam, paper, most carbon, alloy, stainless and tool steels, including: galvanized, titanium, aluminum, copper, nickel, bronze and more, along with most other pre-painted or pre-primed surfaces.  Again, all including a Lifetime Warranty.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our end goal is to create custom (solutions based) formulated products that exceed our customers’ expectations and do so efficiently, effectively, economically and speedily.  This is of course assuming a particular problem cannot be addressed with one of our existing advanced, high-performance RDC paint/coating products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to our existing cutting-edge products, RDC is also aggressively developing similarly amazing, long-lasting, Green/water-based asphalt and concrete repair products, as well as clear-coats and other related amazing products through our closely held, groundbreaking technology and innovation.

                RDC coatings can be easily applied to just about any surface or substrate, including wood, steel, concrete, asphalt, stucco, fiberglass, carbon fiber, glass, plastics/PVC, most composites (you name it) with a standard brush, roller or sprayer like traditional paints, most often without the need of primers. Our coatings are “dry-to-touch” typically in only 15-20 minutes and the second coat can usually be applied within only 1 hour, depending on local weather conditions. Clean-up is fast and easy with simple soap and water.
