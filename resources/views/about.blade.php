                Welcome to Red Diamond Coatings, Inc. I am Bradley J. Kubela, the Founder, President & CEO. I truly appreciate you taking the time to visit our website. Please be advised that we are currently in the process of substantially overhauling our website platform. Accordingly, this is our temporary landing page which only contains some basic information, along with our contact info. Additional interim information will be added during our overhaul project. We apologize for any inconvenience and we thank you in advance for your patience and understanding.

                RDC coatings can be easily applied to just about any surface or substrate, including wood, steel, concrete, asphalt, stucco, fiberglass, carbon fiber, glass, plastics/PVC, most composites (you name it) with a standard brush, roller or sprayer like traditional paints, most often without the need of primers. Our coatings are “dry-to-touch” typically in only 15-20 minutes and the second coat can usually be applied within only 1 hour, depending on local weather conditions. Clean-up is fast and easy with simple soap and water.
